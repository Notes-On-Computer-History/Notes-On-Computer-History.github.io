                <h3>What is Notes on Computer History?</h3>
                <p>
                    Notes on Computer Hisotry(NoCH for short) is a community driven outlet for saccessible scholorship on computer history. That's a longwinded way to say that NoCH is a place for anyone to write about topics in computer history. The aim of this publication is to get more people discussing and researching the origins of our digital world.
                </p>

                <h3>Who is NoCH for?</h3>
                <p>
                    YOU! Download  a copy and give it a whirl, or send in an article for publication!
                </p>

                <h3>What types of submissions are we looking for?</h3>
                <p>
                    NoCH is all about computer history, so topics should fall under that general theme. Submissions can range from original archival research to new documentation about old hardware, historic interviews to musings on long lost formats. If in doubt, shoot us an email!

                    </br></br>

                    We are open to tall kinds of voices here, from expert to novice and everywhere in between. In general NoCH is going for a feel somewhere between pop history and academic journal. A good submission will be fun, accessible, and come with citations (if applicable).
                </p>
            
                <h3>How do you submit?</h3>
                <p>
                    Easy: send us your article! If your submission is accepted for publication then one of our editors will be in touch.
                </p>
